Introduction to System Integration and Architecture

Just by reading the course title, it sounds kind of complicated. So I expect that this subject will
introduce me to new things and ideas that i haven't encountered before.
Im really curious about how integration and architecture is connected to systems.
Even though im not familiar with it yet, im really exited.

I also expect that this subject will me understand how systems connect and work together.
I kinda hope the lessons will start with the basics so i can follow along.
The architecture part is scary though, but im ready to learn about it.
it might be challenging at first, but i think it will be worth it in the end

lastly, i expect that i will learn here something that will be useful in real life, especially
in the field of IT. So with zero knowledge, i want this subject to help learn on how 
system integration and architecture are applied in actual jobs or project.
I expect that my confusion will turn into understanding that will give me skills 
in the future
